# OdysseyXL!

So for the past few weeks I thought to myself what projects I can do to add to my portfolio. Naturally I went to ChatGPT and asked it this prompt:

**If you were a hiring manager at a leading AI company, what would be some portfolio project would you like to see?**

GPT-4o gave me a lot of really good options but there was one particular one that stood out to me. It was to create my own diffusers model. After about an hour of research I decided to stick with SDXL Base 1.0

I went with SDXL for many reasons. Some include:

- **Open Weights**
- **Already a really good model**
- **Stability.ai's community licence**

and many more which I can't remember of the top of my head

I collected data by using hand-collected data by going outside and taking pictures and added them to other images from free image providers (For example Unsplash)

After fine-tuning OdysseyXL, I generated some images to compare the fine-tune with it's based model:

As we can see. The fine-tune can now better generate faces due to the dataset having high-quality images of faces. OdysseyXL can also add more brighter and natural tones to its subjects and it has better prompt adherence compared to SDXL

So in the end, I learnt alot about SDXL and I now have my own fine-tune of it!
