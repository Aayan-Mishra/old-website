## Glacier o1

For the past few weeks, I’ve been thinking about the kind of project that could not only challenge me but also add significant value to my portfolio. Naturally, I turned to ChatGPT and asked the question:

> "If you were a hiring manager at a leading AI company, what portfolio projects would you like to see? (Make it intresting cause I'm bored)"

Among the many excellent suggestions, one idea stood out: creating my own Large Language Model (LLM). After some research, I decided to bring my vision to life with Glacier o1, a model inspired by the state-of-the-art capabilities of o1.

## Why Glacier o1?

There were several reasons I decided to create Glacier o1:

- **High Customizability**: I wanted a model that could adapt seamlessly to various industries and applications.
- **Empowerment**: Glacier o1 is designed to help people solve real-world problems.
- **Performance**: I aimed for a model that delivers ultra-high accuracy and efficiency.

The name "Glacier" symbolizes strength, adaptability, and the ability to carve new paths—traits that are integral to this project.

## The Process

Building Glacier o1 was a rewarding yet challenging experience. Here’s how I approached it:

1. **Model Selection**: I started with a strong base model architecture, ensuring it could support the flexibility and performance I envisioned. In the end I decided with Alibaba's Marco-o1
2. **Fine-Tuning**: Using domain-specific datasets, I trained Glacier o1 to achieve better performance in specialized tasks.
3. **Testing**: Rigorous evaluations were conducted to benchmark Glacier o1 against leading models.

One of the most exciting moments was seeing Glacier o1 excel at tasks like text comprehension, natural language generation, and prompt adherence.

## Try Glacier o1 Yourself!

Here’s a quick way to use Glacier o1:

```python
# Use a pipeline as a high-level helper
from transformers import pipeline

messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Who are you?"},
]
pipe = pipeline("text-generation", model="Spestly/Glacier-o1")
pipe(messages)
```
